Target:
1. Use test.csv data to predict prices as a pricing benchmark.
2. The predicted price can be used as a sales benchmark for salespeople. If the selling price exceeds the predicted price, a higher commission can be shared with the salesperson.
3. Extract the importance of features (feature_importances.csv) from the model, which can be used as a reference for salespeople to negotiate prices with customers.

What can be improved:
1. Use the data of train.csv to visualize the features with higher importance.
